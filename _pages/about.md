Hello and welcome on my page. I am Wael Gafaiti, a 24 year old applied mathematician based in Yverdon-les-Bains (Switzerland). I recently completed my master's degree at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), where I also had completed my bachelor degree in mathematics. During my master's thesis, I had the chance to spend four months at University College London (UCL) within the computer science department. I developed there research interests in data analysis and machine learning while keeping a critical thinking on the benefits of the applications of those innovations in our real world.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I am passionate about sports (basketball or fight sports). As a proud swiss guy, I love to discover mountains either on foot or on cross country ski. And when it’s time to unwind, you can find me listening to house music—a genre that fuels my creativity and energy. I also played some seasons of American football which developed my perseverance.

Thank you for visiting my page, and feel free to connect (especially if you share similar interests)!
