Hello and welcome on my page. I am Wael Gafaiti, a 23 year old applied mathematician based in Lausanne (Switzerland). I recently completed my master's degree at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), where I also had completed my bachelor degree in mathematics. I developed there research interests in data analysis and machine learning while keeping a critical thinking on the benefits of the applications of those innovations in our real world.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I am passionate about sports (basketball or fight sports). As a proud swiss guy, I love to discover mountains either on foot or on cross country ski. And when it’s time to unwind, you can find me listening to or mixing house music—a genre that fuels my creativity and energy.

Thank you for visiting my page, and feel free to connect (especially if you share similar interests)!
